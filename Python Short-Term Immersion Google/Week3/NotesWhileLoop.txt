Structure of the while loop
The while loop continues to execute the code according to the condition value. while, starting with the keyword, followed by the comparison to be evaluated, followed by a colon. The next line has a block of code to execute, and it is indented to the right. Similar to the if statement, the code in the body is executed only if the comparison evaluates to true. However, what distinguishes a while loop is that this block of code will continue to execute as long as the evaluation statement is true. If the statement is no longer true, the loop exits and the next line of code is executed.
