Loop Cheat Sheet
Check out the while loop and for loop syntax below.

while loop
The while loop executes the body of the loop while the condition remains true.

Syntax:
while condition:
    body

Things to keep in mind!

Variable initialization failed.  Ensure that all variables used in the conditions in the loop are initialized before the loop.

Unintentional infinite loops.  Make sure that the body of the loop modifies the variables used in the condition, so that the loop eventually terminates for all possible variable values.

Typical uses:

The while loop is often used when you don't know how many operations to perform and you need to check the condition each time you iterate.

for loop
The for loop iterates over a sequence of elements to execute the loop body for each element in the sequence.

Syntax:
for variable in sequence
    body
    
range() function:

range() produces a series of integers. You can use one, two, or three parameters.

range(n): 0, 1, 2, ... n-1

range(x,y): x, x+1, x+2, ... y-1

range(p,q,r): p, p+r, p+2r, p+3r, ... q-1 (if valid increment)

Common pitfalls:

I forgot that the upper bound of range() is not included.

Repeat a non-sequence. Integers cannot be repeated. Strings can be repeated character-by-character, but this may not be what you want.

Typical uses:

The for loop is often used when you have a predefined sequence or a range of numbers to repeat.

Interruption and continuation
You can use the break keyword to break both the while and for loops. Typically, you do this to abort the cycle due to a separate condition.

You can use the continue keyword to skip the current iteration and continue with the next iteration. This is usually used to move forward when some element of a sequence is unrelated.
