In a past video, you saw the basic concepts of recursive functions.

Recursive functions must contain a recursive case and a base case. The recursive case calls the function back with a different value. The base case returns a value without calling the same function.

Recursive functions typically have the following structure:

def recursive_function(parameters):
    if base_case_condition(parameters):
        return base_case_value
    recursive_function(modified_parameters)
