Understanding the list
You can use a for loop to create a list in a sequence, but there is a more streamlined way to do this. It's a list comprehension. List comprehension allows you to create a new list in a sequence or range on a single line.

For example, [ x*2 for x in range(1,11)] is a simple list comprehension. This iterates through the range 1 through 10 and multiplies each element in the range by 2. This will generate a list of multiples of 2 from 2 to 20.

You can also use conditional statements with list comprehension to write much more complex and powerful statements. You can do this by adding an if statement to the end of the understanding. For example, [ x for x in range(1,101) if x % 10 == 0 ] produces a list containing all integers divisible by 10 from 1 to 100. The if statement I've added here evaluates each value between 1 and 100 to see if it falls apart evenly by 10. If so, it is added to the list.

List comprehension can be really powerful, but it can also be very complex and difficult to read. Be careful when using them. This is because it makes it difficult for anyone else looking at the code to easily understand what the role of that code is.
