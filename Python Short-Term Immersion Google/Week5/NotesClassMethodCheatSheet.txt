Class and Method Cheat Sheet
In the last few videos we've seen how to define classes and methods in Python. Here you can find a summary of everything we've covered, so you can refer to it whenever you need a review.

Defining classes and methods
class ClassName:
    def method_name(self, other_parameters):
        body_of_method

Classes and Instances
A class defines the behavior of all instances of a particular class.

Each variable in a particular class is an instance or an object.

An object can have properties that store information about the object.

You can call a method to make the object work.

The first parameter (self) of the method represents the current instance.

Methods are similar to functions, but can only be used through classes.

Special Methods
The special method starts and ends with __.

Special methods have specific names, such as __init__ for constructors or __str__ for conversion to strings.

Document classes, methods, and functions
You can use a docstring immediately after the definition to add documents to classes, methods, and functions. See the following:

class ClassName:
    """Documentation for the class."""
    def method_name(self, other_parameters):
        """Documentation for the method."""
        body_of_method
        
def function_name(parameters):
    """Documentation for the function."""
    body_of_function
