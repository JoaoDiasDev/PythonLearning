Special Methods
Instead of creating a class that is empty or has default values, you can set these values when you create an instance. This way, you don't miss out on important values and avoid a lot of unnecessary lines of code. For this, I use a special method called a constructor. The following is an example of an Apple class in which a constructor method is defined:
>>> class Apple:
...     def __init__(self, color, flavor):
...         self.color = color
...         self.flavor = flavor
When you call a class name, the constructor of that class is called. The name of this constructor method is always __init__. The special method starts and ends with two underscore characters. In the example above, the constructor method takes its own variables to represent the instance, as well as color and flavor parameters. This parameter is used in the constructor method to set the value of the current instance. You can now create a new instance of the Apple class and set both the color and flavor values.
>>> jonagold = Apple("red", "sweet")
>>> print(jonagold.color)
Red
In addition to the __init__ constructor special methods, there are also __str__ special methods. This method allows you to define how an instance of an object is printed when it is passed to the print() function. If the object does not have this special method defined, it is finished with a default representation that prints the object's position in memory. Not very useful. Here's the Apple class with __str__ methods added:

>>> class Apple:
...     def __init__(self, color, flavor):
...         self.color = color
...         self.flavor = flavor
...     def __str__(self):
...         return "This apple is {} and its flavor is {}".format(self.color, self.flavor)
...

Now, when I pass an Apple object to the print function, I get a string in a nice format.

>>> jonagold = Apple("red", "sweet")
>>> print(jonagold)
This apple is red and its flavor is sweet

When you create an object to print later, it's a good idea to think about how the class will be used and define the __str__ method.
