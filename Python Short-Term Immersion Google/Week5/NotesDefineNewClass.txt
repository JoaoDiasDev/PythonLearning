Detailed classes and objects
You can use the type() function to figure out which class a variable or value belongs to. For example, type(" ") tells you that this is a string class. In this case, the only property is a string value, but there are many methods associated with the class. So far, you've seen the upper() method, which returns a string in full uppercase, and the isnumeric() method, which returns a Boolean value that tells you whether a string is a number. You can use the dir() function to print all the properties and methods of an object. Each string is an instance of a string class that has the same methods as the parent class. Because the contents of the string are different, the method returns a different value. You can also use the help() function for objects that return documentation for that class. This displays all the methods in the class, along with a description of the parameters the method receives, the type of return value, and the method.
