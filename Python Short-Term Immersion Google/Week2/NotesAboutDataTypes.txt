In Python, the text (single quotes or double quotes) between the quotation marks is a string data type. An integer is an integer without a fraction, and a floating point is a real number that can contain fractional parts. For example, 1, 7, and 342 are all integers, and 5.3, 3.14159, and 6.0 are all floating points. Trying to mix incompatible data types can cause TypeError. You can always check the data type using the type() function.
