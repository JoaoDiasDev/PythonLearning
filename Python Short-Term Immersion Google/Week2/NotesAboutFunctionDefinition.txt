We've looked at some examples of built-in functions in Python, but being able to define them on your own is incredibly powerful. Start defining the function with the def keyword and the name you want to give to the function. The name is followed by a parameter (also known as an argument) for the function enclosed in parentheses. A function can have no parameters or multiple parameters. Parameters allow you to call a function and pass data, and the data can be used within a function as a variable with the same name as the parameter. Finally, put a colon at the end of the line.

The colon is followed by the function body. It is important to note that in Python, the body of a function is separated by an indentation. This means that any code indented to the right after the function definition is part of the function body. The first line, which is no longer indented, is the boundary of the function body. The number of spaces you use when indenting is up to you. Be consistent. Therefore, if you choose to indent with 4 spaces, you must use 4 spaces everywhere in your code.
